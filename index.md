### Welcome to my home page

I am a software engineer from Hangzhou, China. Currently, I work at Alibaba Cloud.

I am interested in the design and implementation of distributed storage systems. Currently, I am writing a book on distributed systems and hope to actively contribute to open-source distributed storage system projects.
